# Time-Locked Wallet

## Project Description
The **Time-Locked Wallet** is a Solidity-based smart contract that allows users to deposit funds into a wallet with a time lock mechanism. The funds can only be withdrawn after a specified time, providing a secure way to lock funds for a defined period. This wallet ensures that the owner cannot access the funds before the predetermined unlock time, making it ideal for saving funds or holding them securely.

## Project Vision
The vision for the Time-Locked Wallet is to provide users with a simple yet powerful way to lock their funds in a smart contract, ensuring that the funds cannot be accessed until the specified unlock time has passed. This project aims to offer a secure, transparent, and efficient way to manage time-sensitive funds in a decentralized environment.

## Key Features
- **Time Lock**: Funds can only be withdrawn after the specified unlock time.
- **Deposit Function**: Users can deposit Ether into the contract, which will be stored until the unlock time.
- **Withdraw Function**: The owner of the wallet can withdraw the funds after the unlock time has passed.
- **Balance Check**: Users can check the current balance of the wallet at any time.
- **Extend Lock Time**: The owner can extend the unlock time if needed, offering flexibility.
- **Security**: Only the contract owner can withdraw funds, preventing unauthorized access.

## Future Scope
- **Token Support**: Extend the contract to support ERC-20 tokens for deposits and withdrawals.
- **Multi-Signature Support**: Implement a multi-signature mechanism for added security and authorization flexibility.
- **Automated Withdrawals**: Implement a feature that allows automated withdrawals after the unlock time has passed.
- **Enhanced User Interface**: Develop a frontend interface for users to interact with the contract seamlessly.
- **Custom Lock Period**: Allow users to set their own custom unlock periods instead of a fixed one.
- **Decentralized Governance**: Implement governance mechanisms to allow the community to vote on changes to the contract's functionality.
